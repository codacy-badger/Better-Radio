# Better-Radio
Better Radio, but betterer

## Requirements
Node.js

Clone this repo/branch, then open the Better-Radio folder in your terminal/command prompt.

Then run the following:
```bash
npm install
```
This installs the dependencies. 

Now to run the local dev server, run:
```bash
npm run serve
```

Alternatively, this is built using Vue CLI 3 which supports a GUI for running and monitoring the server.
```bash
vue ui
```
Then use the 'serve' task to run the local server.

Your local server should be running on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
