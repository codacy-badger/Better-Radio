# Better Radio
> Voices in your head

## What is, what do

It's a simple podcast web app. Pocket Casts but it's free and simple. Spotify for podcasts, but it's not blocked by workplaces.

## If contribute, what do

Just clone the repo, and run it on your localhost or just open it as a local file. There's no fancy-ass install process yet to run it locally.

Create a new branch for any changes and create a pull request when done. We've got [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/projects) running for code reviews and eventually some tests on every commit + pull request.

## Testing
Currently we have Codacy and Code Climate automated reviews on our commits/pull requests to keep our code less spaghetti-like.

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ef6459597a6044cd927bf5d2c7b92639)](https://www.codacy.com/app/honsaar/Better-Radio?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=honsaar/Better-Radio&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

### Deployment

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1dd38d9b-544a-4f31-b07a-c27559a74f19/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/better-radio/deploys)

We have a Netlify instance running at: [https://better-radio.netlify.com/](https://better-radio.netlify.com/)

### To do
-  Set up an instance of Travis CI or CircleCI when we switch over to a Node.JS project using Vue CLI or Nuxt.
-  Get a less shitty Maintainability score
