# Better Radio

## What is, what do

It's a simple podcast web app. Pocket Casts but it's free and simple. Spotify for podcasts, but it's not blocked by workplaces.

## If contribute, what do

Just clone the repo, and run it on your localhost or just open it as a local file. There's no fancy-ass install process yet.
