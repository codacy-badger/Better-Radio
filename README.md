# Better Radio
> Voices in your head

## What is, what do

It's a simple podcast web app. Pocket Casts but it's free and simple. Spotify for podcasts, but it's not blocked by workplaces.

## If contribute, what do

Just clone the repo, and run it on your localhost or just open it as a local file. There's no fancy-ass install process yet to run it locally.

Create a new branch for any changes and create a pull request when done. We've got [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/projects) running for code reviews and eventually some tests on every commit + pull request.

### To do:
- Set up an instance of Travis CI or CircleCI when we switch over to a Node.JS project using Vue CLI or Nuxt.
- Get a less shitty Codacy score: [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/758ea31dd43e47b9bf98b00dadcd8cca)](https://www.codacy.com/app/honsaar/Better-Radio?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=honsaar/Better-Radio&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)
